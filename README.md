My idea is that the clock will be a cycle of the sun, moon and stars 

I change my idea into a scenary which the star will fly from the right to the left and for every star appear is every minute
The moon will be the same as the star
I intended to make a day scenary which the sun will replace the moon and the clouds will replace the stars
