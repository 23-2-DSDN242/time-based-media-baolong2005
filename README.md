## MDDN 242 Project 1: Time-based Media  

### THIS IS YOUR README
My idea is that the clock will be a cycle of the sun, moon and stars 

I change my idea into a scenary which the star will fly from the right to the left and for every star appear is every minute
The moon will be the same as the star
I intended to make a day scenary which the sun will replace the moon and the clouds will replace the stars
I just finished to copy the maeda clock 
I just added some code for the movement of the moon
I added day and night
The sun/moon can move forward but not backward to create a cycle
I added code to change the color of the ground 
I added clouds code for day and stars code for night
